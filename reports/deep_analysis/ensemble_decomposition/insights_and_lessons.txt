ENSEMBLE COMPONENT ANALYSIS INSIGHTS
================================================================================

KEY INSIGHTS:
----------------------------------------
1. ⚠️  GBM has negative R² in test period but better than experimental models
2. ℹ️  SARIMA struggles but provides diversification
3. ✅ Ensemble 87.7% better than best component (diversification benefit)
4. 🎯 Ensemble 88.0% better than experimental XGBoost
5. ℹ️  Ridge meta-learner heavily weights SARIMA (87.7%) - relies on seasonality


LESSONS LEARNED:
----------------------------------------
1. Component Diversity: Use multiple model types (tree-based, time series, etc.) to capture different aspects of regime dynamics
2. Adaptive Meta-Learning: Ridge regression learns optimal weights automatically rather than fixed weights
3. Simpler Components: Individual GBM/SARIMA components may be simpler than experimental XGBoost (25 features)
4. Feature Stability: GBM likely uses Phoenix-specific features that maintain relationships across regimes (employment YoY growth)
5. Regularization: Ridge regression provides implicit regularization, preventing overfitting to any single component


RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------------------------------

[HIGH] Implement Ensemble Architecture
  Use ensemble of diverse models rather than single complex model
  Action: Create XGBoost + SARIMA + LightGBM ensemble with Ridge meta-learner

[HIGH] Simplify Feature Sets
  Reduce from 25 to 5-10 most stable features
  Action: Focus on employment_yoy_growth and seasonality-stable features

[HIGH] Add Seasonal Component
  SARIMA captures patterns that remain stable across regimes
  Action: Implement SARIMAX experimental variant

[MEDIUM] Adaptive Weighting
  Let meta-learner adjust weights based on recent performance
  Action: Implement Ridge or elastic net meta-learner

[MEDIUM] Component Specialization
  Different models capture different regime aspects
  Action: XGBoost for Phoenix dynamics, SARIMA for seasonality, VAR for macro

[LOWER] Online Learning
  Update weights as new data arrives
  Action: Implement rolling window meta-learner retraining
