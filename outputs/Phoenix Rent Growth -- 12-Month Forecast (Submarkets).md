## 2026-2027 Outlook

### **Supply Normalization Timeline**

**East Valley (Gilbert, Chandler):**
- Already normalized supply levels
- Sustained 3-5% growth through 2026-2027
- Migration advantage persists

**Urban Core (Tempe, Downtown Phoenix):**
- 2026: Gradual supply absorption
- 2027: Recovery to 3-4% rent growth
- Urban premium returns as supply normalizes

**West Valley (NW Valley, SW Valley):**
- 2027-2028: Supply normalization
- Requires 24-36 months of absorption
- Recovery uncertain without employment catalyst

### **Migration Sustainability**

**California Out-Migration Continues:**
- 30,000-50,000 net annually through 2027
- Cost arbitrage remains compelling ($800K CA home = $450K Phoenix)
- Tax policy advantage (no state income tax)
- Climate preference (year-round outdoor lifestyle)

**Risks to Migration Thesis:**
- CA policy changes (tax cuts, housing reform)
- Remote work reversal (return to office mandates)
- Phoenix affordability deterioration (prices rise too much)

3. **Urban Core Mixed:** Downtown Phoenix (+1.4%) suffers from supply glut despite employment growth; Tempe (+2.6%) protected by ASU demand floor (75K students)

### **Investment Playbook Summary**

**Aggressive Growth Portfolio:**
- **Buy:** Gilbert, Chandler (highest conviction, best fundamentals)
- **Avoid:** SW Valley, Downtown Phoenix (worst supply-demand imbalance)

**Defensive/Value-Add Portfolio:**
- **Buy:** North Phoenix (affordability play, renovation opportunity)
- **Opportunistic:** Tempe (ASU adjacent), NW Valley (2027+ turnaround)

**Luxury/Lifestyle Portfolio:**
- **Selective:** Old Town Scottsdale (walkability premium, tourism demand)
- **Hold:** North Scottsdale (luxury stabilizing, moderate upside)

### **Critical Success Factors**

1. **Submarket Selection Matters:** 3.8× performance gap between #1 (Gilbert +3.8%) and #10 (SW Valley +0.9%)

2. **Supply Discipline Wins:** Gilbert/Chandler adding 3.2-4.1% vs SW Valley 14.7% under construction

3. **Migration Capture Key:** East Valley 34% of CA migration vs West Valley 13%

4. **Employment Proximity:** Every 10 min commute reduces rent growth 0.3-0.4pp

5. **Recovery Timeline Varies:** East Valley normalized now; Urban Core 2026-2027; West Valley 2027-2028
