- ✅✅ **Strong buy:** Best risk-adjusted returns in market
- ✅ **Defensive:** Performs well in all scenarios (recession, baseline, boom)
- ✅ **Value-add potential:** Renovation upside (unit interiors, amenities)
- **Best For:** All investor types, optimal risk-return profile
- **Target Basis:** $150-200K/unit all-in (acquisition + capex)

#### Class C (Pre-1990 Construction)

**36-Month Outlook:**
- Rent Growth: +2.5% avg (affordability segment)
- Occupancy: 90-92% (management intensive)
- Concessions: Variable (depends on condition)

**Investment Case:**
- ⚠️ **Selective:** Only if significant value-add opportunity
- ❌ **Avoid:** California migrants prefer quality (B/A), not Class C
- **Best For:** Experienced operators with repositioning expertise
- **Risk:** Execution risk high, resident quality concerns

### Leverage Strategy

**Current Environment (Nov 2024):**
- Agency debt: 5.5-6.0% (5-year), 5.8-6.3% (10-year)
- Bank debt: 6.0-6.5% (floating), SOFR + 225-275bps
- Life company: 5.7-6.2% (10-year fixed)

**Recommended Approach:**
- ✅ **Fixed-rate bias:** Lock rates before Fed pause (Q2-Q3 2025)
- ✅ **Moderate leverage:** 60-65% LTV (conservative, recession buffer)
- ✅ **Long duration:** 10-year terms preferred (match hold period)
- ⚠️ **Avoid floating:** Unless 2-3 year exit planned (rate risk)

**Scenario-Based Leverage:**

| Scenario | Recommended LTV | Rate Type | Term |
|----------|----------------|-----------|------|
| Recession (>35% prob) | 50-55% | Fixed | 10-year |
| Baseline (40-45% prob) | 60-65% | Fixed | 7-10 year |
| Boom (>20% prob) | 65-70% | Fixed/Float | 5-7 year |

### Confidence Interval Construction

**Conformal Prediction Method:**
```python
# Step 1: Train ensemble on training set
ensemble_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 2: Generate predictions on calibration set
cal_predictions = ensemble_model.predict(X_cal)

# Step 3: Calculate non-conformity scores (absolute errors)
nonconformity_scores = np.abs(y_cal - cal_predictions)

# Step 4: Determine quantile for coverage level (e.g., 80%)
alpha = 0.20  # 1 - 0.80
q_80 = np.quantile(nonconformity_scores, 1 - alpha)

# Step 5: Construct intervals for test set
test_predictions = ensemble_model.predict(X_test)
lower_80 = test_predictions - q_80
upper_80 = test_predictions + q_80

# Empirical coverage check
coverage = np.mean((y_test >= lower_80) & (y_test <= upper_80))
# Should be ≈80% (guaranteed by conformal prediction theory)
```

### Time Series Cross-Validation Protocol

**Never use standard k-fold CV for time series (causes data leakage).**

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit

# Rolling window CV: Train on 36 months, forecast 12 months
tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(
    n_splits=10,      # 10 train/test splits
    test_size=12,     # Forecast horizon
    gap=0             # No gap between train/test
)

for fold, (train_idx, test_idx) in enumerate(tscv.split(X), 1):
    X_train, X_test = X.iloc[train_idx], X.iloc[test_idx]
    y_train, y_test = y.iloc[train_idx], y.iloc[test_idx]

    # Train and evaluate
    ensemble.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = ensemble.predict(X_test)

    # Calculate fold metrics
    fold_mape = mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_test, predictions)
    print(f"Fold {fold} MAPE: {fold_mape:.2f}%")
```
