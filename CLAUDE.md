# Rent Growth Analysis Project Instructions for Claude

## Project Overview
Rent Growth Analysis project

## Dart MCP Tool Configuration

### MANDATORY: Dart MCP Tool Usage
**ALL project management MUST use the Dart MCP tool. This is NOT optional.**

### Rent Growth Analysis Project Configuration
1. **Workspace**: Rent Growth Analysis
2. **Dartboard**: `Rent Growth Analysis/Tasks`
3. **Docs Folder**: `Rent Growth Analysis/Docs`

**IMPORTANT**: Use the full path format (workspace/folder) when calling Dart MCP functions!

## Task Management Rules

1. **Always use Dart MCP for tasks** - No exceptions
2. **Valid Task Status Values**:
   - `To-do` - For new tasks
   - `Doing` - When actively working on a task
   - `Done` - When task is completed
3. **Valid Priority Values**:
   - `Critical`
   - `High`
   - `Medium`
   - `Low`
4. **When starting work on a task**:
   - Set status to `Doing`
   - Use TodoWrite tool in parallel to track subtasks
5. **When updating a task**:
   - NEVER modify the task details/title
   - ONLY add comments to track progress
6. **When completing a task**:
   - Set status to `Done`
   - Update TodoWrite tool accordingly
7. **Task creation**:
   - Create tasks in `Rent Growth Analysis/Tasks` dartboard
   - Include clear descriptions
   - Set appropriate priority

## Git Workflow

- Commit messages should be descriptive
- NO co-authored details in commits
- NO 🤖 Generated with Claude Code
- Use conventional commit format when possible

## Documentation Rules

1. **All .md files created locally MUST be duplicated in Dart**
2. **Documentation goes in `Rent Growth Analysis/Docs` folder**
3. **Keep documentation synchronized**:
   - When creating local .md files, immediately create in Dart
   - When updating local .md files, update Dart version
4. **Documentation structure**:
   - Mirror local folder structure in Dart where possible
   - Use clear, descriptive titles

## Development Guidelines

### Detail-Oriented Implementation

**BE DETAIL-ORIENTED AND COMPLETE ALL FUNCTIONALITY**

1. **Forms and Data Flow**:
   - When creating forms, ensure ALL collected data is properly saved
   - Track data flow from frontend through APIs to backend
   - Verify that no form fields are being ignored or lost
   - Map form field values correctly to their types

2. **Dynamic Pages and Features**:
   - Implement all promised functionality, not just UI shells
   - Ensure data is properly fetched, displayed, and can be modified
   - Connect all interactive elements to their backend functionality
   - Test the complete user flow, not just individual components

3. **Before Marking Complete**:
   - Verify data persistence (can create, read, update, delete)
   - Check that all form fields are functional
   - Ensure proper error handling
   - Test the complete feature flow end-to-end

### Testing Commands
- Test: `npm test`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Type check: `npm run typecheck`

## Project-Specific Context

### Technology Stack
# Development tools

### Running the Application
`project_init.sh\`

## Important Reminders
- Focus on complete implementation, not partial features
- Always test features end-to-end before marking complete
- Maintain clean, well-documented code
- Follow the project's established patterns and conventions

- Use Dart MCP for ALL task management without exception
